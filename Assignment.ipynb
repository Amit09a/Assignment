        "Question 1: What is a Decision Tree, and how does it work in the context of classification?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "A Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. In classification, it works by recursively splitting the dataset based on feature values to create branches that lead to a class label.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, each branch represents an outcome of that decision, and each leaf node represents a predicted class. The tree selects splits using impurity measures such as Gini Impurity or Entropy to maximize class separation. During prediction, a data point traverses the tree from root to leaf following the decision rules, and the class at the leaf node is assigned as the output.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 2: Explain the concepts of Gini Impurity and Entropy as impurity measures. How do they impact the splits in a Decision Tree?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "Gini Impurity and Entropy are metrics used to measure the impurity or disorder of a dataset at a node.\n",
        "\n",
        "Gini Impurity measures the probability of incorrectly classifying a randomly chosen sample if labels were assigned randomly according to class distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Entropy measures the amount of uncertainty or information disorder in the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lower impurity values indicate purer nodes. During tree construction, the algorithm evaluates all possible splits and selects the one that results in the maximum reduction in impurity. Gini tends to be faster computationally, while Entropy provides a more information-theoretic interpretation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 3: What is the difference between Pre-Pruning and Post-Pruning in Decision Trees? Give one practical advantage of using each.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "Pre-Pruning stops the tree from growing further during training by setting constraints such as maximum depth or minimum samples per split.\n",
        "Advantage: Reduces overfitting and training time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Post-Pruning allows the tree to grow fully and then removes unnecessary branches after training.\n",
        "Advantage: Often results in better generalization since pruning decisions are based on validation performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 4: What is Information Gain in Decision Trees, and why is it important for choosing the best split?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "Information Gain measures the reduction in entropy achieved after splitting a dataset based on a feature. It quantifies how much information a feature provides about the target variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "The feature with the highest Information Gain is chosen for splitting because it best separates the data into distinct classes. This ensures that each split improves the model’s ability to classify data correctly.\n",
