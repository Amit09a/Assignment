        "1. What is a Support Vector Machine (SVM)?\n",
        "\n",
        "- A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding an optimal hyperplane that separates data points of different classes with the maximum margin. The main objective of SVM is to maximize the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from each class, which are called support vectors. By maximizing this margin, SVM improves generalization and reduces overfitting, making it effective in high-dimensional spaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Difference Between Hard Margin and Soft Margin SVM\n",
        "\n",
        "- Hard Margin SVM assumes that the dataset is perfectly linearly separable and does not allow any misclassification. It strictly maximizes the margin while ensuring all data points are correctly classified. However, it is highly sensitive to noise and outliers. Soft Margin SVM, on the other hand, allows some misclassifications by introducing slack variables and a penalty parameter (C). This makes Soft Margin SVM more practical for real-world datasets where perfect separation is not possible.\n",

        "4. Role of Lagrange Multipliers in SVM\n",
        "\n",
        "- Lagrange multipliers are used to convert the constrained optimization problem of SVM into a dual optimization problem. This allows the solution to be expressed in terms of dot products between data points. The dual formulation enables the use of kernel functions and simplifies computation, especially in high-dimensional spaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are Support Vectors?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Support vectors are the data points closest to the decision boundary (hyperplane). These points directly influence the position and orientation of the hyperplane. Removing non-support vectors does not change the model, but removing support vectors would alter the decision boundary significantly.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is Support Vector Classifier (SVC)?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Support Vector Classifier (SVC) is the classification implementation of SVM. It finds an optimal hyperplane that separates classes with maximum margin. It supports different kernels to handle both linear and non-linear classification problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is Support Vector Regressor (SVR)?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Support Vector Regressor (SVR) is the regression variant of SVM. Instead of maximizing the margin between classes, SVR attempts to fit a function within a specified error tolerance (epsilon). It minimizes prediction error while keeping the model as flat as possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the Kernel Trick?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The Kernel Trick allows SVM to operate in high-dimensional feature spaces without explicitly computing transformations. It replaces dot products with kernel functions such as Linear, Polynomial, or RBF, enabling non-linear classification efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Compare Linear, Polynomial, and RBF Kernel\n",
        "\n",
        "- The Linear kernel is used when data is linearly separable and is computationally efficient. The Polynomial kernel maps data into higher-degree polynomial feature space and is useful when relationships are non-linear but structured. The RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernel maps data into infinite-dimensional space and is highly flexible, making it effective for complex, non-linear patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Effect of C Parameter\n",
        "\n",
        "- The C parameter controls the trade-off between maximizing margin and minimizing classification error. A large C prioritizes minimizing misclassification, resulting in smaller margin and possible overfitting. A small C allows larger margin but tolerates more misclassification, improving generalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. Role of Gamma in RBF Kernel\n",
        "\n",
        "- Gamma defines how far the influence of a single training example reaches. A high gamma makes the decision boundary more complex and sensitive to individual points. A low gamma creates smoother decision boundaries.\n",

Naïve Bayes is a generative model that estimates probabilities and is computationally faster. SVM performs better with complex decision boundaries, while Naïve Bayes is better for text classification and small datasets.\n",
